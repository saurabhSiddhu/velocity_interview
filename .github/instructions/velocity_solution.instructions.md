# Daily Mock Interview Preparation Instructions (Velocity Software Solutions)

As your coding and interview expert, follow these comprehensive instructions to help prepare daily mock interview questions and solutions for practice:

> **Note:** See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again. For all coding problems, provide at least one approach that does not use built-in methods like `reverse()`, `repeat()`, or array methods unless specifically allowed. Demonstrate multiple approaches (iterative, recursive, etc.) where possible.

1. **Daily Mock Interview Set Structure:**

   - Each day, generate a set of mock interview questions covering:
     - Aptitude (quantitative, logical reasoning)
     - C Language MCQs (output prediction, error identification, core concepts)
     - Coding (JavaScript, focusing on arrays, strings, patterns, DSA basics)
     - Short essay/article writing (tech or general topics)

2. **Question Counts and Format:**

   - Each day must include:
     - 10 Aptitude questions (rotating topics)
     - 10 C MCQs (mix of output prediction and error finding)
     - 5 JavaScript coding problems (varied types, increasing difficulty)
     - 1 Essay prompt (tech/general, 150-400 words)
   - Organize questions and solutions in clearly named files/folders by day (e.g., `day1/`).

3. **Difficulty and Topic Progression:**

   - Ensure questions increase in difficulty as the week progresses, starting from fundamentals and moving to intermediate/advanced topics.
   - Rotate and expand topics for each section daily (e.g., time & work, profit & loss, speed & distance, percentages, ratios, logical reasoning, etc. for aptitude).
   - For coding, include a mix of problem types (functions, array manipulation, string operations, pattern printing, recursion, etc.).

4. **C Language MCQs:**

   - Include daily MCQs on:
     - Predicting output of C code snippets (input/output based questions)
     - Identifying errors in C code (syntax, logical, runtime)
     - Cover topics such as loops, arrays, pointers, functions, and common pitfalls
     - Provide a mix of output prediction and error finding

5. **JavaScript Coding:**

   - Prefer JavaScript for coding questions.
   - For string reversal and pattern printing, provide at least two methods without using the built-in `reverse()`, `repeat()`, or array methods unless specifically allowed (e.g., use for/while loops, recursion).
   - For all coding problems, encourage and demonstrate multiple approaches where possible (e.g., iterative, recursive, functional, etc.), and provide detailed explanations for each.
   - Avoid unnecessary edge-case handling unless specified in the question.
   - Include clear, well-commented code and step-by-step explanations for every approach.

6. **Essay/Article:**

   - Suggest relevant topics (e.g., technology trends, e-commerce, teamwork, AI, etc.)
   - Specify a word limit (150-400 words).
   - Provide a model essay with clear structure (introduction, body, conclusion) and key points.

7. **Instructions and Review:**

   - Provide clear instructions and sample questions for each section every day.
   - Encourage review and self-assessment after each mock interview, and suggest focusing on weak areas in subsequent days.
   - Adapt the daily plan based on previous performance and feedback, ensuring a balanced mix of topics and increasing challenge.
   - Always include time management tips and reminders to practice explaining solutions out loud.

8. **Solutions and Explanations:**

   - For every daily mock interview set, generate detailed solutions and explanations for all questions in a separate file named `mock_solutions_DAY.md` (where DAY is the day number or date).
   - Solutions must include:
     - Step-by-step explanations for aptitude and reasoning questions
     - Well-commented JavaScript code for coding problems (with at least two methods not using `reverse()`, `repeat()`, or array methods for string reversal and pattern printing, and multiple approaches for other problems where possible)
     - Model essay/article samples with structure and key points
     - For C MCQs, provide the correct answer, code output, and explanation of errors if any

9. **File Organization:**
   - Organize all files in day-specific folders (e.g., `day1/`, `day2/`, etc.) for clarity and future expansion.
   - Name files clearly (e.g., `mock_day1_aptitude_c.md`, `mock_day1_js_sql_essay.md`, `mock_solutions_day1_aptitude_c.md`, `mock_solutions_day1_js_sql_essay.md`).

Follow these instructions strictly to ensure a comprehensive, educational, and well-structured mock interview preparation experience for Velocity Software Solutions candidates.

1. **Aptitude:**
   - Increase the complexity and depth of daily aptitude questions as the week progresses. Include multi-step problems and questions requiring advanced reasoning or calculations from Day 2 onward. Rotate topics (e.g., time & work, profit & loss, speed & distance, percentages, ratios, logical reasoning, ages, mixtures, compound interest, permutations & combinations, etc.) and ensure a mix of quantitative, logical, and interpretive questions. Do not repeat any aptitude question on any day. Avoid data interpretation questions unless specifically requested. For later days, include questions that combine multiple concepts.
