# Day 2: JavaScript Coding, SQL, and Essay

## JavaScript Coding Problems (5 Questions)

1. **Reverse a String (No built-in reverse, two methods):**
   Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in `reverse()` or array methods. Provide both iterative and recursive solutions. (Increase difficulty: handle Unicode and spaces)

2. **Find the Kth Largest Element in Array:**
   Write a function to find the Kth largest number in an array without using built-in sort. (K is a parameter)

3. **Check for Anagram:**
   Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (case-insensitive, ignore spaces). Provide both iterative and recursive solutions.

4. **Print Number Pyramid Pattern:**
   Print the following pattern for n = 4 (no `repeat()` or array methods):

   ```
      1
     1 2
    1 2 3
   1 2 3 4
   ```

   Provide both iterative and recursive solutions.
